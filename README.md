## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether college players will be drafted in the NBA, based on their current season statistics. 

- The predictive model training was developed as part of a Kaggle competition, where each team member trained the best model of the week and submitted the drafted probability results to Kaggle. 
- Area Under ROC (AUROC) was used to evaluate the model performance. 
- The weekly model training notebooks are stored in the notebooks folder.
